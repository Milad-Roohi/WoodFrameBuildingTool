$\bullet$ $\textbf{Introduction}$ 

This tool is originally developed as part of Zhengxiang's Ph.D. research work, and served for PEER-CEA and Los Angeles Soft Weak Open-Front Building projects. Some MATLAB functions, modules and solvers are developed by Henry V. Burton, Yu Zhang, Zhiheng Li and Xingquan Guan. 

The tool can realize autimation in woodframe building 3D nonlinear OpenSees model generating, eigen analysis, nonlinear-static analysis and nonliear-dynamic analysis in OpenSees, post-processing and FEMA P-58 based loss assessment. 

Environment requirement: Python 3 or higher, numpy, os, pandas, sys, distutils, subprocess packages; OpenSees (set up in the environment path and environment variable), tcl.
