JointNodeNumbers.txt: Used to define beam-column joint node numbers. Each row entry corresponds to a single node. Use the following numbering scheme: "ABCD" where A = 9, B = 1 for X-Frame and 2 for Z-Frame, C = Column Line Number and D = Floor Level
JointNodeCoordinates.txt: Used to define coordinates for beam-column joint nodes. The row entry for the node numbers and coordinates should match. For example, a node whose number is entered in row i of JointNodeNumbers.txt should have the coordinate entered in row i of JointNodeCoordinates. The first, second and third entries in row i correspond to the X, Y and Z coordinates of that node respectively
BeamHingeNodeNumbers.txt: Used to define beam hinge node numbers. Each row entry corresponds to a single node. Use the following numbering scheme: "ABCD" where A = 8, B = 1 for X-Frame and 2 for Z-Frame, C = Column Line Number and D = Floor Level
BeamHingeNodeCoordinates.txt: Used to define coordinates for beam hinge nodes. As is the case for the joint nodes, the row entry for the node numbers and coordinates should match. 
ColumnHingeNodeNumbers.txt: Used to define column hinge node numbers. Each row entry corresponds to a single node. Use the following numbering scheme: "ABCD" where A = 7, B = 1 for X-Frame and 2 for Z-Frame, C = Column Line Number and D = Floor Level
ColumnHingeNodeCoordinates.txt: Used to define coordinates for column hinge nodes. As is the case for the joint nodes, the row entry for the node numbers and coordinates should match.
